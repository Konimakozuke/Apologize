    <h1>I'm sorry.</h1>

    <p>
      Yesterday, I made you feel like you didn't matter to me.
      Even if that wasn't what I felt inside, I understand that what matters
      is how my actions looked to you.
    </p>

    <p>
      I chose to be busy. I chose not to make time.
      And because of that, I hurt you.
      I take responsibility for that.
    </p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <p>
      You deserve to feel cared for, not postponed.
      You deserve presence, not excuses.
      I failed at that yesterday, and I'm genuinely sorry.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm not writing this to pressure you to forgive me.
      I just want you to know that I do care — more than I showed.
      And I am reflecting seriously on how to do better.
    </p>
